# Road-crossing game
In this Python game, the player controls a turtle to cross a busy road while avoiding the randomly generated cars. The objective of the game is to reach the other side of the road safely, without getting hit by a car.

# How to Play
Install Python 3 and the turtle module.
Run the index.py file in a Python IDE or command prompt.
Use the arrow key to move the turtle up.
